    "+ *States* in quantum mechanics (QM) are described mathematically as **vectors in a vector space**\n",
    "+ Things that are measurable are called physical *observables* and are described as **linear operators**\n",

    "+ Observables are associated with a vector space (they are not state vectors, though)\n",
    "+ The process of doing a quantum calculation has been described as starting with a vector, say $ \\left| B \\right> $, putting it through a machine, **M**, and getting a result, which is another vector, say $ \\left| B \\right> $\n",
    "+ In bra-ket notation that would be $ M\\left|A\\right>=\\left|B\\right> $\n",
    "+ There are plenty constraints on the linear operator $M$ (they will become clear in time)\n",
    "    + A linear operator must give a unique output for every vector in the vectors (state) space\n",
    "    + When acting on a scalr multiple of a vector it must give the same scalar multiple of the output vector, $Mz\\left|A\\right>=z\\left|B\\right>$\n",
    "    + $M$ acting on the sum of vectors must equal the sum of $M$ acting on each vector, $M\\left\\{\\left|A\\right>+\\left|B\\right>\\right\\}=M\\left|A\\right>+M\\left|B\\right>$\n",
    "+ We have seen before that a vector in a chosen vector space is a linear combination of orthonomal basis vectors for that spacce\n",
    "    + Let's say for a orthonormal basis vector set, $\\left|j\\right>$, we have $\\left| A \\right> =\\sum _{ j }^{  }{ { \\alpha  }_{ j }\\left |j \\right>  } $\n",
    "    + This makes $\\left|B\\right>={\\beta}_{j}\\left|j\\right>$, leaving $\\sum _{ j }^{  }{ M\\left| j \\right> { \\alpha  }_{ j } } =\\sum _{ j }^{  }{ { \\beta  }_{ j }\\left |j \\right>  } $\n",
    "    + If we take the inner product of both sides with a particular basis vector, $\\left<k\\right|$, we get $\\sum _{ j }^{  }{ \\left< k|M|j \\right> { \\alpha  }_{ j } } =\\sum _{ j }^{  }{ { \\beta  }_{ j }\\left< k|j \\right>  } $\n",
    "    + Becasue of the orthonormal basis vectors we have the right-hand side equal to zero, unless $j$ and $k$ are equal, resulting in a right-hand side of ${\\beta}_{k}$"
