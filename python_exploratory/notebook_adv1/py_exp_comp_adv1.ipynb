      "###Bisection method\n",
      "The Bisection method is a simple method to find the zero of a function. The user needs to specify the function $f(x)$ and two values of $x$ between which $f(x)$ is zero - let's call those two points $x_1$ and $x_2$. As $f(x)$ equals zero somewhere between $x_1$ and $x_2$, that means that $f(x)$ is positive at $x_1$ or $x_2$ and negative at the other one. In other words, the product of the two function values is negative: $f(x_1)f(x_2)<0$. If this condition is fulfilled, all we know is that $f(x)$ is zero somewhere in the interval between $x_1$ and $x_2$ (provided $f(x)$ is continuous, of course). The basic idea of the bisection method is to iterate towards the zero of the function by cutting the interval in half every iteration. This is done by computing the middle between $x_1$ and $x_2$, let's call that point $x_m$, and compute $f(x_m)$. Next, replace either $x_1$ or $x_2$ by $x_m$ making sure that $f(x)$ remains negative at one of the two values and positive at the other. Repeat the process until the interval is small enough. In summary, the algorithm works as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Compute $f(x)$ at $x_1$ and $x_2$ and make sure that $f(x_1)f(x_2)<0$.\n",
      "2. Compute $x_m = \\frac{1}{2}(x_1+x_2)$.\n",
      "3. Compute $f(x_m)$.\n",
      "4. If $f(x_m)f(x_2)<0$, replace $x_1$ by $x_m$, otherwise, replace $x_2$ by $x_m$.\n",
      "5. Test whether $|x_1-x_2|<\\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon$ is a user-specified tolerance. If this is not yet the case, return to step 2."
