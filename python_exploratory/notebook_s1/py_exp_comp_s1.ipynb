One day before the elections, the company of 'Maurice the Dog' conducts a pole among 1000 randomly chosen voters. We will investigate what the probability is that the Dog will predict the winner correctly. First, generate 1000 uniformly distributed values between 0 and 1 and count the number of values below 0.49 (votes for candidate $A$). Specify a seed of 50. If your code is correct, the number of people voting for candidate $A$ in the pole is 501, so the Dog will predict that candidate $A$ wins."

Does the probability that the Dog will predict the correct winner increase significantly when he poles 5000 voters?"
